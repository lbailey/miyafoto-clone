<!--<h1>Welcome to the new miyamoto-foto app! </h1>-->

<p>This photo tool is integrated with over one Terabyte of storage for all of our OSC Photo Book images. It's dynamic, asynchronous, and has a relatively basic design and structure. It's divided into separate sections: View and Upload. </p><p><br></p>


<p class="helperText bold pad10">Upload</p>

<p>Select the year and album with which your photos fit best. If the album doesn't exist, feel free to add it. Select the images you would like to upload (for files over 5Mb, never try more than four to five at a time). These images will upload to the server, and the browser on the right of the screen will auto-refresh, letting you see your newly posted images. 

</p><p><span class="black bold">*note of caution</span><br>

Heroku is a free hosting platform for very powerful web services. The only caveat is that it actually needs to "warm up". While no one is using the site, it's given very little bandwidth. If you load it up and it's slow, no worries. It'll pick up the pace the moment you start to use it. If an image is lagging (one should never take more than 10 seconds), you just might be the first one to use the service in a while. 

</p><p><br></p>
<p class="helperText bold pad10">View</p>

<p>Select a year and an album from the left column to view photos. To download the original (very large or raw) image, hover and click 'download'.
