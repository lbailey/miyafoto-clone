<h1>Welcome to the new miyamoto-foto app! </h1>

<p>I'm so excited to have this running and ready to receive event photos! This photo tool is integrated with over one Terabyte of storage for all of our OSC Photo Book images. It's dynamic, asynchronous, and has a relatively basic design and structure. It's set up in three separate parts: Upload, View, and Browse. </p><p><br></p>


<p class="helperText bold pad10">Upload</p>

<p>Select which album your photos fit best. Once you click that album, an upload button will appear. Select the images you would like to upload (for files over 5Mb, never try more than four to five at a time). These images will upload to the server, and the browser on the right of the screen will auto-refresh, letting you see your newly posted images. 

</p><p><span class="black bold">- note of caution -</span><br>

Heroku is a free hosting platform for very powerful web services. The only caveat is that it actually needs to "warm up". While no one is using the site, it's given very little bandwidth. If you load it up and it's slow, no worries. It'll pick up the pace the moment you start to use it. Upload one image at first, then feel free to upload dozens at a time after that! If an image is lagging (one should never take more than 10 seconds), you just might be the first one to use the service in a while. 

</p><p><br></p>
<p class="helperText bold pad10">View</p>

<p>There are two ways to click through to see large photos: slide and grid. Clicking on an image will bring up a larger size, and to return, simple click anywhere again. Use the Album Browser to the right, click a title, and the Image Viewer will appear in this area.
</p><p><br></p>
<p class="helperText bold pad10">Browse</p>

<p>Here you can quickly glance at the album contents. These are sorted by most recently updated/added. Click on the Album Title to open the pictures in the Viewer. 

</p><p><br></p>
<p class="helperText bold pad10">Features Coming Soon</p>

<p><span class="bold">Secure Login: </span>this is my main priority.</p> 
<p><span class="bold">Add New Album: </span>trickier than I expected.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Multi Year Support: </span>Since we have massive storage, we can host these pictures for a few years at a time. This should help to make sure we always have the best opportunity for fun pictures. </p>
